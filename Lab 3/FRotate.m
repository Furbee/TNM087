function RImage = FRotate(OImage, center, degangle )
%FRotate Rotate an image around a given point
%   Everybody has to use this template
%
%% Who has done it
%
% Author: Same LiU-ID/name as in the Lisam submission
% Co-author: You can work in groups of max 2, this is the LiU-ID/name of
% the other member of the group
%
%% Syntax of the function
%
% Input arguments:  OImage original image
%                   center 2-vector with center point of the rotation 
%                       see the pdf for an definition of center
%                   degangle rotation angle in degrees, rotation is 
%                       clockwise
%
% Output arguments: RImage is the rotated image
%
% You MUST NEVER change the first line
%
%% Basic version control (in case you need more than one attempt)
%
% Version: 1
% Date: today
%
% Gives a history of your submission to Lisam.
% Version and date for this function have to be updated before each
% submission to Lisam (in case you need more than one attempt)
%
%% General rules
%
% 1) Don't change the structure of the template by removing %% lines
%
% 2) Document what you are doing using comments
%
% 3) Before submitting make the code readable by using automatic indentation
%       ctrl-a / ctrl-i
%
% 4) In case a task requires that you have to submit more than one function
%       save every function in a single file and collect all of them in a
%       zip-archive and upload that to Lisam. NO RAR, NO GZ, ONLY ZIP!
%       All non-zip archives will be rejected automatically
%
% 5) Often you must do something else between the given commands in the
%       template

%% Use cir and cic in meshgrid to generate a coordinate grid
%
[C,R] = meshgrid(cir,cic); % cir, cic
